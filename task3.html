                            In infor&shy;mation systems, a tag is a keyword or term
                            assigned to a piece of infor&shy;mation (such as an
                            Inter&shy;net book&shy;mark, digital image, data&shy;base
                            record, or com&shy;puter file). This kind of meta&shy;data
                            helps des&shy;cribe an item and allows it to be found again by
                            brow&shy;sing or sear&shy;ching.<sup>[1]</sup> Tags are
                            gene&shy;rally chosen infor&shy;mally and per&shy;sonally by
                            the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system,
                            although they may also be chosen from a con&shy;trolled

                            HTML attri&shy;butes are special words used inside the opening
                            tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attri&shy;butes
                            are a modi&shy;fier of an HTML element type. An attri&shy;bute
                            either modifies the default function&shy;ality of an element
                            type or provides function&shy;ality to certain element types
                            unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an
                            attri&shy;bute is added to an HTML start tag.

                            An HTML element is an indi&shy;vidual component of an HTML
                            (Hyper&shy;text Markup Language) document or web page.[vague]
                            HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes.
                            Each node can have HTML attri&shy;butes speci&shy;fied. Nodes
                            can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many
                            HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the
                            &lt;title&gt; node repre&shy;sents the title of the document.
